Project title

Pitch recognition to plate approach: a data-driven swing decision model + matchup gameplan generator

Core question

How can we use pitch-level tracking data to identify where a hitter’s swing decisions cost them value — and turn that into a simple, actionable gameplan against a specific pitcher?

Inputs & data

Pitch-level dataset (Statcast via pybaseball)

Pitch location: plate_x, plate_z

Count: balls, strikes

Pitch characteristics: pitch_type, release_speed, pfx_x, pfx_z (movement), (optional: spin, extension if available)

Handedness: stand (batter), p_throws (pitcher)

Outcome fields: events / description (swing, whiff, foul, in-play, called strike/ball)

Scope recommendation

Pick one season (e.g., 2023, 2024, or 2025) or a half-season to manage size

Pick one team’s hitters (clean narrative + manageable)

Combined pipeline overview

You will build three layers that feed each other:

Swing Decision Model (predict swing probability and “good decision” zones)

Expected Value Layer (quantify cost of swings/takes by zone/shape/count)

Gameplan Generator (turn the above into 3–5 matchup rules + visuals)

Part A — Swing decision modeling (Plan 1)
A1) Define targets

You’ll create two labels, one for prediction, one for coaching value:

Target 1: did_swing (classification)

1 if swing (includes whiff/foul/in-play)

0 if take (called strike/ball)

Target 2: decision_value (evaluation metric)

A numeric value that measures “how good was that decision?”

You can keep this simple and defensible:

If take → value based on ball vs called strike

If swing → value based on whiff/foul/in-play result (and quality if available)

(This lets you say: “We don’t just predict swings — we quantify which swings were costly.”)

A2) Feature engineering

Core features (must-have)

plate_x, plate_z

balls, strikes

pitch_type

release_speed

pfx_x, pfx_z

stand, p_throws

Helpful additions

Previous pitch type (for anticipation)

In-zone flag (based on plate_x/z strike zone bounds)

Pitch “shape buckets” (group pitch types into families)

A3) Modeling approach

Baseline

Logistic regression (easy, explainable)

Primary model

Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM or sklearn HistGradientBoosting)

Output: P(swing | features)

Evaluation

AUC / log loss for the classifier

Calibration curve (video-friendly)

Most importantly: show that higher model swing probability corresponds to higher positive outcomes

A4) Convert model output into visuals

Create a strike-zone grid (e.g., 30×30 bins):

For each bin, compute:

average model P(swing)

actual swing rate

average decision value (or cost)

Visuals produced

Decision heatmap: model swing probability by zone

Mistake cost heatmap: where swings/takes lose the most value

Top mistake table: hitter’s most costly chase zones + pitch families

Part B — Expected value layer (bridges into Plan 12)
B1) Define a simple “value” system

Pick one approach:

Option A (simpler): outcome weights

Assign weights to outcomes, like:

take a ball = +

take a called strike = −

swing & miss = −−

foul = small −

ball in play = depends (single/double/HR positive; out negative)

Option B (stronger if available): use Statcast run value / wOBA-based metrics

If your pitch-level data includes a run value column, use that.

Output you need either way
For each pitch context, estimate:

EV if swing

EV if take

EV swing − EV take (this is your “optimal decision” signal)

B2) Aggregate into coaching insights

For a given hitter (and optionally split vs RHP/LHP), compute:

Worst zones by negative EV swing−take

Worst pitch families (shape buckets) by negative EV

Count-specific weaknesses (0–0 vs 1–2, etc.)

This becomes your “approach foundation” before you even pick a pitcher.

Part C — Matchup gameplan generator (Plan 12)

Now you take the hitter profile + a specific pitcher’s tendencies and generate the plan.

C1) Build pitcher tendency tables

For the selected pitcher:

Pitch mix by count (and by batter handedness)

Location tendencies by pitch type (heatmaps per pitch)

“Go-to” sequences (optional): pitch after pitch

C2) Combine hitter weaknesses + pitcher tendencies

Create a scoring function that ranks “what the hitter is likely to see” AND “what hurts them most.”

Example score for a pitch family + zone + count:

Likelihood (pitcher throws it here in this count)
× Damage (hitter loses EV here vs that shape)
= Priority

C3) Generate 3–5 rules (the gameplan card)

Rules should be short, count-aware, and visual-backed. Examples:

Early count hunt: “On 0–0 / 1–0, look middle-up for four-seam; don’t expand glove-side.”

Chase rule: “Lay off sweepers that start off the plate (you lose the most value there).”

Two-strike rule: “With 2 strikes, protect top rail; take below-zone breaker unless it starts middle.”

Sit/ambush: “If previous pitch was a fastball, slider probability spikes — be ready.”

C4) Matchup visuals for the video

Pitcher mix by count chart

Pitcher location heatmap for the top 2 pitches

Your gameplan card (text + mini-icons + 1–2 tiny heatmaps)

Final deliverables (what you submit / show)
1) Notebook (analysis)

Matchup gameplan generation

Results + limitations

2) Visual output package

Auto-export images:

hitter_decision_map.png

hitter_mistake_cost_map.png

pitcher_mix_by_count.png

matchup_gameplan_card.png

3) Optional demo app (high value for video)

A small Streamlit tool:

choose hitter

choose pitcher

generates the 4 key visuals + gameplan card live

Suggested success criteria (easy to justify in a presentation)

The swing model predicts swing decisions reasonably (AUC/log loss)

The “mistake cost” map isolates zones that align with intuitive baseball truth (e.g., chase breaking balls down/away)

The matchup card is consistent with pitcher tendencies (count-based mix) and hitter weaknesses

You can demonstrate 1–2 matchups end-to-end in under 2 minutes on video
